It is recommended to create small maps. Creating a map requires some considerable time and it might take a lot of energy and resources. Always try to create the smallest map possible, of maximum a few kilometres long.


It is better to have several small maps for different points of interests instead of having a big map. Also it requires less resources, memory, and time.
